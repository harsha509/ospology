## TODO End of Year Review - Recommendations for 2025

The TODO Group’s mission is to identify key policy and process choices related to open source management and engagement within organizations and create tools and educational materials that promote best practices. As part of this mission, the TODO Steering Committee gathered on November 18 at the Linux Foundation Member Summit for their annual End-of-Year meeting. The session provided an opportunity to reflect on the group’s strategic goals for the year and outline the priorities for the upcoming year, based on recent studies and open source management trends.

## State of Open Source Management 2024 Research Study 
The talent behind Open Source Program Offices is cross-skilling in specific industry verticals and technologies, according to the [2024 State of OSPOs and Open Source Management report](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/ospo-2024). With 84% of OSPOs involved in managing GenAI infrastructure and 91% of OSPOs involved in managing security issues, these insights underscore the evolving role of open source management talent as not only facilitators of open source adoption but also as pivotal players in driving innovation, ensuring compliance, and mitigating risks in the software supply chain.
